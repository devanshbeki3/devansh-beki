      <p>My sweetest Jasleen,</p>
      <p>There are a thousand ways to say “I’m sorry,” but none feel enough when it comes to you. I’ve spent countless moments replaying everything — your laughter, your voice, the way your eyes light up when you talk about the little things you love. Every memory feels like home, and I can’t stand that I’m the reason it’s quiet now.</p>
      <p>I hurt you — and that truth stays heavy on my heart. You never deserved that. You’ve always been my calm in the chaos, my reason to smile when the world feels too loud. And yet, I failed to protect the peace you brought into my life.</p>
      <p>If I could, I’d hold your hand again and tell you what I should’ve said sooner — that you are my heart, my comfort, my everything. I don’t want grand apologies; I just want another chance to make you feel the love you’ve always given me so effortlessly.</p>
      <p>I’m sorry, Jasleen. For every tear, every silence, every second you doubted my love. I promise — I’ll love you louder, softer, and truer than before.</p>
      <p class="closing">Forever yours,<br>Devansh</p>
